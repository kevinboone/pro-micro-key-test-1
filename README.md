# pro-micro-keytest-1

A demonstration of how to use the SparkFun Pro Micro (or similar) 
to implement a USB keypad for a workstation, using a cheap 4x4 
switch matrix. This is the first step towards implementing a 
custom mechanical keyboard from first principles.

Keyboard.\* and HID.\* are taken from the Arduino libraries, for ease of
building with a Makefile. If you're using the Arduino IDE, just include
keytest.cpp in a sketch -- the other files are not needed.
